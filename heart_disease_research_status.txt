Subject: Live Research Paper Collector Status Report

Dear Researcher,

I attempted to collect real research papers about heart disease as requested, but encountered some limitations:

?? Search Results:
- Query: "Get 3 new papers about recent heart disease"
- arXiv API Status: Limited results for medical topics
- Issue: arXiv focuses on computer science, physics, mathematics

 What arXiv Contains:
- Machine Learning & AI papers 
- Computer Vision   
- Neural Networks 
- Bioinformatics (limited)
- Medical research (very limited)

 Alternative Solutions:
1. Use medical databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore)
2. Search for AI applications in healthcare
3. Look for computational biology papers

 System Status:
- Email sending: Working perfectly
- AI summarization: Ready
- Real paper collection: Working for CS topics
- Frontend display: Beautiful and functional

 Ready for:
- Computer science papers
- AI/ML research
- Data science papers
- Physics and mathematics

Would you like me to:
1. Try AI healthcare papers instead?
2. Send computer science papers as demo?
3. Configure other research databases?

Best regards,
AI Research Assistant
